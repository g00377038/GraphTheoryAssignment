# GraphTheoryAssignment
This repository contains my work from the 'Graph Theory' module. In the repository there are two Jupyter notebooks, one contains information about the 'Heap Sort' algorithm and the other contains information about 'Graph Isomorphism'.  Neither notebook contains an exhaustive explanation of their respective subjects. Instead, in them, I have created a collection of useful explanations, definitions and examples of the subjects' key points. 


## _Topics Covered_
 **Heap Sort Notebook:**
 * Tree Terminology
 * Definitions of Tree Data Structures
 * Definition of Heap Sort Algorithm
 * Step-Through Guide of Heap Sort Algorithm
 * Implementation of Heap Sort in Python
 * Definition of Bubble Sort Algorithm
 * Implementation of Bubble Sort in Python
 * Time Complexity Terminology
 * Best and Worst Case for Heap Sort

**Graph Isomorphism Notebook:**
* Graph Terminology
* Graph Isomorphism Definition
* Specification of 'The Graph Isomorphism Problem'
* Examples of Isomorphic and Non-Isomorphic Graphs
* Applications of Graph Isomorphism testing


## _Install_
I recommend installing <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html">Anaconda</a>. Installing Anaconda will give you Python along with many commonly used libraries and packages. In particular, Anaconda will give you access to Jupyter which you can use to open up and interact with the notebooks.

## _Running_
* Once you clone and open up the repository using Jupyter, you will be able to fully interact with the notebooks. You will be able to modify, or add, code and run it through the notebook. 

## _Helpful Links_
